\title{Create consensus peaks from multiple samples}
\usage{
make_consensus_peaks(peak_files, min_samples = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{peak_files}{Named character vector of peak file paths (BED format).
Names should be sample identifiers.}

\item{min_samples}{Integer minimum number of samples required for consensus
(default: NULL, auto-calculates as max(2, 30\% of samples))}
}
\value{
GRanges object containing consensus peaks with names "Peak_1", "Peak_2", etc.
}
\description{
Merges peaks across samples and retains only reproducible peaks
found in multiple samples. Uses a reproducibility threshold requiring
peaks to be present in at least 30\% of samples (minimum 2).
}

peak_files <- c(
  "sample1" = "sample1_peaks.bed",
  "sample2" = "sample2_peaks.bed"
