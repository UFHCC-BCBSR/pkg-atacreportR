\title{Create DESeqDataSet from peak and BAM files}
\usage{
create_dds_from_peaks(peak_files, bam_files, sample_info, min_samples = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{peak_files}{Named character vector of peak file paths (BED format).
Names should match sample identifiers in sample_info.}

\item{bam_files}{Named character vector of BAM file paths.
Names should match sample identifiers in sample_info.}

\item{sample_info}{Data frame with sample metadata. Must have a "sample" column
matching the names of peak_files and bam_files.}

\item{min_samples}{Integer minimum number of samples for consensus peaks
(default: NULL, auto-calculates as max(2, 30\% of samples))}
}
\value{
DESeqDataSet object with:
\itemize{
\item Count matrix as assay
\item Sample metadata in colData
\item Consensus peaks as rowRanges
}
}
\description{
Integrates consensus peak calling, read counting, and sample metadata
to create a DESeqDataSet object ready for differential accessibility analysis.
