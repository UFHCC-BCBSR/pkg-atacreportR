\title{Run differential accessibility analysis across multiple contrasts}
\usage{
run_differential_analysis(dge, peaks_anno, contrast_strings, report_params)
}
\arguments{
\item{dge}{A DGEList object containing normalized count data}

\item{peaks_anno}{Data frame containing peak annotations}

\item{contrast_strings}{Character vector of contrast specifications (e.g., "1. Heat vs Control")}

\item{report_params}{List of analysis parameters including min_count_for_filtering and min_prop_for_filtering}
}
\value{
A named list where each element contains the differential accessibility
results (topTags output) for one contrast
}
\description{
This function performs edgeR-based differential accessibility analysis
for ATAC-seq consensus peaks across multiple experimental contrasts.
