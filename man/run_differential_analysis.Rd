\title{Run differential accessibility analysis across multiple contrasts}
\usage{
run_differential_analysis(dge, contrasts, min_count = 10, min_prop = 0.7)
}
\arguments{
\item{dge}{A DGEList object containing normalized count data. Must have
dge$genes populated with peak annotations.}

\item{contrasts}{Character vector of contrast specifications in format
"Group1_vs_Group2" (e.g., c("Heat_vs_Control", "Treated_vs_Untreated"))}

\item{min_count}{Minimum count threshold for filterByExpr (default: 10)}

\item{min_prop}{Minimum proportion threshold for filterByExpr (default: 0.7)}
}
\value{
A named list where each element contains the differential accessibility
results (topTags output) for one contrast
}
\description{
This function performs edgeR-based differential accessibility analysis
for ATAC-seq consensus peaks across multiple experimental contrasts.
