\title{Run differential accessibility analysis across multiple contrasts}
\usage{
run_differential_analysis(
  dge,
  contrast_strings,
  min_count = 10,
  min_prop = 0.7
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dge}{A DGEList object containing normalized count data. Must have
dge$genes populated with peak annotations including an 'interval' column.}

\item{contrast_strings}{Character vector of contrast specifications (e.g., "1. Heat vs Control")}

\item{min_count}{Minimum count threshold for filterByExpr (default: 10)}

\item{min_prop}{Minimum proportion threshold for filterByExpr (default: 0.7)}
}
\value{
A named list where each element contains the differential accessibility
results (topTags output) for one contrast
}
\description{
This function performs edgeR-based differential accessibility analysis
for ATAC-seq consensus peaks across multiple experimental contrasts.
